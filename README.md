This is 100% real, but on Chrome only! 

How to use:

Copy any of the links by pressing the ‘*copy raw contents’ button which looks like two squares.

Then you gotta right-click the bookmarks bar and then you click "*add new page."

Once you have done it, you should name the name, "*Multitool."

Lastly, go to the URL and put "Javascript:" and then paste the code into it. (no spaces!)
